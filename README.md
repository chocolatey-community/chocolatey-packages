### Description

This repository contains Chocolatey packages, most of which are [automatically](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/automatic-packages) updated.

These packages are managed and maintained by the Chocolatey Community. To get a package added here, the official [Chocolatey Community Account](http://community.chocolatey.org/profiles/chocolatey-community) has to have push access to the package on [community.chocolatey.org](http://community.chocolatey.org).

**All packages in this repository should conform with the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).** Contributions that follow the guideliness are welcome.
All packages in this repository are expected to be installable with any version of Chocolatey being made available in the past 12 months, unless a dependency on Chocolatey has been added.

### Etiquette Regarding Communication

When requesting support, try to remember that we are all volunteers that have lives outside of open source and none of us are paid to ensure things work for you, so please be considerate of others' time when you are asking for things. Many of us have families that also need time as well and only have so much time to give on a daily basis. A little consideration and patience can go a long way. Thanks for understanding.

### Where This Fits into Chocolatey

This repository is maintained by a group of volunteers. There may be some overlap with members of the Chocolatey Team.

**Disclaimer**: This repository may contain packages that may not be officially sanctioned by Chocolatey, and that is okay. Typically if there is a legal issue, then a member of the Chocolatey Team will step in. If you want to speak directly to the Chocolatey Team and don't feel comfortable reaching out here, please use the [contact form at https://chocolatey.org/contact](https://chocolatey.org/contact) and select "Website".
