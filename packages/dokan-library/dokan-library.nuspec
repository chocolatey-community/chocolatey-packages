User mode file system for windows, FUSE for windows. When you want to create a new file system on Windows, for example to improve FAT or NTFS, you need to develope a file system driver. Developing a device driver that works in kernel mode on windows is extremley difficult. By using Dokan library, you can create your own file systems very easily without writing device driver. Dokan Library is similar to FUSE (Linux user mode file system) but works on Windows.

### Note

As of June 2015, the Dokan Library is no longer actively maintained.

Installer doesn’t work silently if Dokan Library is already installed. The uninstaller also doesn’t work silently.
