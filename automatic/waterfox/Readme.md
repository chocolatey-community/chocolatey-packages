## How and why Waterfox is here...
Waterfox was started back in March 2011 by [Alex Kontos](https://github.com/MrAlex94), a 16 year old student.
He had a fascination for the web and wanted to help expand on the ideals of what Mozilla had for a free and open web.
And so he decided to make Waterfox, a 64-Bit browser based on Mozilla's free and open source platform.

Waterfox was one of the first widely distributed 64-Bit browsers on the web and quickly gained a loyal following.
At a time Waterfox had one thing in mind: speed, but now Waterfox also attempts to be an ethical, user-oriented browser

Waterfox focuses on giving users choice while also helping make the world a better place.
Watefox is partners with Ecosia, a search engine that plants trees with its generated revenues.
The browser itself is focused on power users, which lets you make the important decisions.
There is no plugin whitelist, you can run whichever extensions you like and absolutely no data or
telemetry is sent back to Mozilla or the Waterfox project.
