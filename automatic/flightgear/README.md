FlightGear is an open-source flight simulator.
It supports a variety of popular platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) and is developed by skilled volunteers from around the world.
Source code for the entire project is available and licensed under the GNU General Public License.

The goal of the FlightGear project is to create a sophisticated and open flight simulator framework for use in research or academic environments,
pilot training, as an industry engineering tool, for DIY-ers to pursue their favorite interesting flight simulation idea,
and last but certainly not least as a fun, realistic, and challenging desktop flight simulator.
