    <summary>GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC4880 (also known as PGP)</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[GnuPG itself is a commandline tool without any graphical stuff. It is the real crypto engine which can be used directly from a command prompt, from shell scripts or by other programs. Therefore it can be considered as a backend for other applications.

However, even when used on the command line it provides all functionality needed - this includes an interactive menu system. The set of commands of this tool will always be a superset of those provided by any frontends.

- Decrypts and verifies PGP 5, 6 and 7 messages
- Supports ElGamal, DSA, RSA, AES, 3DES, Blowfish, Twofish, CAST5, MD5, SHA-1, RIPE-MD-160 and TIGER
- Easy implementation of new algorithms using extension modules
