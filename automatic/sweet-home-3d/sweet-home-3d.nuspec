Sweet Home 3D is a free interior design application that helps you draw the plan of your house, arrange furniture on it and visit the results in 3D.

## Features
- **Draw** straight, round or sloping **walls** with precise dimensions using the mouse or the keyboard.
- **Insert doors and windows** in walls by dragging them in the plan, and let Sweet Home 3D compute their holes in walls.
- **Add furniture** to the plan from a searchable and extensible catalog organized by categories such as kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom...
- **Change color, texture**, size, thickness, location and orientation of furniture, walls, floors and ceilings.
- While designing the home in 2D, **simultaneously view it in 3D** from an aerial point of view, or navigate into it from a virtual visitor point of view.
- **Annotate the plan** with room areas, dimension lines, texts, arrows and show the North direction with a compass rose.
- **Create photorealistic images and videos** with the ability to customize lights and control sunlight effect according to the time of day and geographic location.
- **Import** home blueprint to draw walls upon it, [3D models](http://www.sweethome3d.com/importModels.jsp) to complete default catalog, and [textures](http://www.sweethome3d.com/importTextures.jsp) to customize surfaces.
- **Print and export** ODFs, bitmap or vector graphics images, videos and 3D files in standard file formats.
- **Extend the features** of Sweet Home 3D with [plug-ins](http://www.sweethome3d.com/pluginDeveloperGuide.jsp) programmed in Java, or by developing a derived version based on its Model View Controller architecture.
- **Choose the language** displayed in the user interface of Swee Home 3D and its rich help from [25 languages](http://www.sweethome3d.com/translations.jsp).
