    <description><![CDATA[
iTunes is the best way to organize and enjoy the music, movies, and TV shows you already have and shop for the ones you want to get. It's home to Apple Music, which gives you unlimited access to millions of songs, curated playlists,1 and Beats 1 radio, hosted by Zane Lowe and a team of acclaimed DJs. Enjoy all the entertainment iTunes has to offer on your Mac and PC.

## Notes

This package installs iTunes, the required Apple Application Support component, Apple Mobile Device Support and Bonjour, but not the Apple Software Update component. The latter is intrusive and thus probably undesirable for many user because it recommends unnecessary additional software from Apple.
