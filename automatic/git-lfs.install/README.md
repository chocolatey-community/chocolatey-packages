Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise.

## Features

* **Large file versioning:** Version large files-even those as large as a couple GB in size-with Git.
* **More repository space:** Host more in your Git repositories. External file storage makes it easy to keep your repository at a manageable size.
* **Faster cloning and fetching:** Download less data. This means faster cloning and fetching from repositories that deal with large files.
* **Same Git workflow:** Work like you always do on Git-no need for additional commands, secondary storage systems, or toolsets.
* **Same access controls and permissions:** Keep the same access controls and permissions for large files as the rest of your Git repository when working with a remote host like GitHub.
