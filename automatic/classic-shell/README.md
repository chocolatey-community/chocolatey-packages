Classic Shell is a collection of usability enhancements for Windows. The main features are:

## Features

- Highly customizable start menu with multiple styles and skins
- Quick access to recent, frequently-used, or pinned programs
- Find programs, settings, files and documents
- Start button for Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10
- Toolbar and status bar for Windows Explorer
- Caption and status bar for Internet Explorer

## Notes

- If you want to install only specific components, e.g. only the Start Menu, use
`choco install classic-shell -installArgs ADDLOCAL=ClassicStartMenu`. If Classic Shell gets updated, you won't have to specify the `-installArgs` again. It remembers your previous selection and will only install the component you have specified. To look for other possible installer arguments, go to http://www.classicshell.net/faq/#install_commands
