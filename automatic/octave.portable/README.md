## GNU Octave - Scientific Programming Language

GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.

Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in Octave’s own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.

### Features:
* Powerful mathematics-oriented syntax with built-in plotting and visualization tools
* Drop-in compatible with many Matlab scripts
* Octave Forge, a central location for development of packages for GNU Octave, similar to Matlab's toolboxes.
* Free software, runs on GNU/Linux, macOS, BSD, and Windows
