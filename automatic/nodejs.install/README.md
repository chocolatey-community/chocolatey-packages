Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

This package runs the official Node JS installer, resulting in Node.exe and NPM being installed under Program Files, and added to the SYSTEM PATH environment variable.

## Notes
While this package now provides both **Current** and **LTS** releases of Node.js, it is still recommended to use the [nodejs-lts][] package if only targeting the latest LTS release is required.
