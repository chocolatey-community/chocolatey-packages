Yeoman is a generic scaffolding system allowing the creation of any kind of app.
It allows for rapidly getting started on new projects and streamlines the maintenance of existing projects.

Yeoman is language agnostic.
It can generate projects in any language (Web, Java, Python, C#, etc.)

Yeoman by itself doesn't make any decisions.
Every decision is made by generators which are basically plugins in the Yeoman environment.
There's a [lot of publicly available generators](http://yeoman.io/generators/) and its easy to [create a new one](http://yeoman.io/authoring/) to match any workflow.
Yeoman is always the right choice for your scaffolding needs.
