    <description><![CDATA[The Tor software protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location, and it lets you access sites which are blocked.

The Tor Browser Bundle lets you use Tor on Windows without needing to install any software. It comes with a pre-configured web browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained.

## Package Parameters

- `/Locale:` - Allows changing the language to download tor-browser fol.
- `/InstallDir:` - Allows changing the installation directiory to put tor browser in.

## Notes

- Starting from version 8.5, support for 64 bit editons of tor browser is now also included.
  There is currently no check to see if a 32bit edition is already installed. Use the `--x86` argument
  if there is a wish to keep using the 32bit edition.
