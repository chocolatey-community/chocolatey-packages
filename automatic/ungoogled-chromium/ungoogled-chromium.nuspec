    <description>ungoogled-chromium is a set of configuration flags, patches, and custom scripts. These components altogether strive to accomplish the following:
* Disable or remove offending services and features that communicate with Google or weaken privacy
* Strip binaries from the source tree, and use those provided by the system or build them from source
* Add, modify, or disable features that inhibit control and transparency (these changes are minor and do not have significant impacts on the general user experience)

ungoogled-chromium should not be considered a fork of Chromium. The main reason for this is that a fork is associated with more significant deviations from the Chromium, such as branding, configuration formats, file locations, and other interface changes. ungoogled-chromium will not modify the Chromium browser outside of the project's goals. Since these goals and requirements are not precise, unclear situations are discussed and decided on a case-by-case basis.</description>
