MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

## Features

* **Host anywhere:** MkDocs builds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub pages, Amazon S3, or [anywhere](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/) else you choose.
* **Great themes available:** There's a stack of good looking themes available for MkDocs. Choose between the built in themes: [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/styling-your-docs/#mkdocs) and [readthedocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/styling-your-docs/#readthedocs), select one of the 3rd party themes in the [MkDocs wiki](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes), or [build your own](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/custom-themes/).
* **Preview your site as you work:** The built-in dev-server allows you to preview your documentation as you're writing it. It will even auto-reload and refresh your browser whenever you save your changes.
* **Easy to customize:** Get your project documentation looking just the way you want it by customizing the theme.
