Material is a theme for [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), an excellent static site generator geared towards project documentation. It is built using Google's [material design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design) guidelines, full responsive, optimized for touch and pointer devices as well as all sorts of screen sizes.

## Features

* Beautiful, readable and very user-friendly design based on Google's material design guidelines, packed in a full responsive template with a well-defined and [easily customizable color palette](http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#changing-the-color-palette), great typography, as well as a beautiful search interface and footer.
* Well-tested and optimized Javascript and CSS including a cross-browser fixed/sticky header, a drawer that even works without Javascript using the [checkbox hack](http://tutorialzine.com/2015/08/quick-tip-css-only-dropdowns-with-the-checkbox-hack/) with fallbacks, responsive tables that scroll when the screen is too small and well-defined print styles.
* Extra configuration options like a [project logo](http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#adding-a-logo), links to the authors [GitHub and Twitter accounts](http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#adding-a-github-and-twitter-account), display of the amount of stars the project has on GitHub and [Google Analytics integration](http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#google-analytics-integration).
* Easily [extendable and customizable](http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/customization/) due to a well-designed asset pipeline built on-top of [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) with npm and bower and modular and abstracted style definitions built with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).
* Web application capability on iOS - when the page is saved to the homescreen, it behaves and looks like a native application.
