    <summary>The most powerful set of tools available to create your Windows installation experience. Free and Open Source since 2004!</summary>

    <description><![CDATA[
The Windows Installer XML (WiX) is a toolset that builds Windows installation packages from XML source code. The toolset supports a command line environment that developers may integrate into their build processes to build MSI and MSM setup packages.

The core of WiX is a set of build tools that build Windows Installer packages using the same build concepts as the rest of your product: source code is compiled and then linked to create executables; in this case .exe setup bundles, .msi installation packages, .msm merge modules, and .msp patches. The WiX command-line build tools work with any automated build system. Also, MSBuild is supported from the command line, Visual Studio, and Team Build.

WiX includes several extensions that offer functionality beyond that of Windows Installer. For example, WiX can install IIS web sites, create SQL Server databases, and register exceptions in the Windows Firewall, among others.

With Burn, the WiX bootstrapper, you can create setup bundles that install prerequisites like the .NET Framework and other runtimes along with your own product. Burn lets you download packages or combine them into a single downloadable .exe.

The WiX SDK includes managed and native libraries that make it easier to write code that works with Windows Installer, including custom actions in both C# and C++.

    <releaseNotes>WiX v3.14.1 is the latest recommended maintenance release of WiX v3; it contains mitigations in all versions of WiX v3 for a vulnerability affecting all bundles and a WiX custom action. We recommend upgrading to WiX v3.14.1--or the latest WiX v4.0--as soon as possible.

For more information about the vulnerability, see the [FireGiant blog](https://www.firegiant.com/blog/2024/3/22/wix-security-releases-available-redux/).

### Files

* wix314.exe is the installer for the WiX Toolset build tools.
* wix314exe.zip contains the wix314.exe installer inside a .zip file, useful if your IT department prevents direct downloading of .exe files.
* wix314-binaries.zip contains the files that make up the WiX Toolset and is useful if you don't want to install the toolset -- for example, if you're just checking WiX into source control.
* wix314-debug.zip contains a reference copy of the WiX source code and symbol (.pdb) files, both of which are useful when debugging problems with WiX.</releaseNotes>
