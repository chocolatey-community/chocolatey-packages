cdrtfe is an open source CD/DVD/BD burning application for Microsoft Windows. You can burn data discs, Audio CDs, XCDs, (S)VCDs and DVD-Video discs. It supports creation and writing of ISO images and bootable discs. Disc images and Audio CDs can be written simultaneously to multiple writers.

cdrtfe is a win32 frontend for the cdrtools (cdrecord, mkisofs, readcd, cdda2wav), Mode2CDMaker, VCDImager and other well-known tools.

## Notes

- In cdrtfe, go to *Extras > Settings > cdrtfe* and activate _Save on exit_. This will make your settings persistent and lets you change the language, which otherwise would lead to an access right error.
