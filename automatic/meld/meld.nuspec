Meld is a visual diff and merge tool. You can compare two or three files and edit them in place (diffs update dynamically).
You can compare two or three folders and launch file comparisons. You can browse and view a working copy from popular version control systems such such as CVS, Subversion, Bazaar-ng and Mercurial.
Written with Python and GTK. While in theory meld could be compiled for Windows and OS X currently there is no download for these platforms so we do not list it as cross platform.
