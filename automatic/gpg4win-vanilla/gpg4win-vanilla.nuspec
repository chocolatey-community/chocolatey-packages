    <description>Gpg4win-vanilla (GNU Privacy Guard for Windows) only installs the actual file encryption and digital signature command-line tool gpg.exe.

Gpg4win enables users to securely transport emails and files with the help of encryption and digital signatures. Encryption protects the contents against an unwanted party reading it. Digital signatures allow authors of files to sign them prior to distribution so a user may verify the file has not been tampered with and comes from a specific sender.

Gpg4win supports both relevant cryptography standards, [OpenPGP](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt) and Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) X.509 certificates, and is the official GnuPG distribution for Windows.

It is maintained by the developers of GnuPG. Gpg4win and the software included with Gpg4win are Free Software (Open Source; among other things free of charge for all commercial and non-commercial purposes).

## Features

* Supports OpenPGP and S/MIME
* High algorithmic strength of GnuPG
* SmartCards for OpenPGP and S/MIME
* Sign single files or complete folders directly from the Windows Explorer with GpgEX or Kleopatra
* Create and verify checksums of files directly from the Windows Explorer or Kleopatra
* Outlook email plugin
