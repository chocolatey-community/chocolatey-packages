## Ketarin Jobs

* Ensure you perform the steps in `setup/README.md`.

This is where the ketarin xml job exports go. This allows it to be easier to contribute when Ketarin jobs are available for exporting.

This is also the folder that ops/ketarinupdate.cmd is using to import all of the jobs into Ketarin silently, so that things stay updated on a server running this.
