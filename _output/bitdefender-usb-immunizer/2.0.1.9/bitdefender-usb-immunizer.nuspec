        <description>Bitdefender USB Immunizer is a handy utility designed to allow users to immunize their USB storage devices or SD cards against infections with autorun-based malware.
For years, Autorun-based malware has been atop of the worldwide e-threat landscape, with notorious representatives such as Trojan.AutorunInf, the Conficker worm (Win32.Worm.Downadup) or Worm.Autorun.VHD.
Introduced back in the Windows XP era to facilitate software installations from CD-ROM media for non-technical computer users, the Autorun feature has rapidly become the infection vector of choice for cyber-criminals.
Bitdefender USB Immunizer is a response to this growing issue.</description>
